    <h4>Grade Appeal Policy</h4>
    <p>
      Each CSU Global course clearly defines the instructional objectives of the
      course at the beginning of each term and provides guidelines for
      evaluating student achievement in a manner consistent with the stated
      objectives. Students are responsible for maintaining standards of academic
      performance established for each course in which they are enrolled.
      Instructors are responsible for determining and assigning final course
      grades. Course assignments, discussions, and other graded materials used
      when evaluating a student's achievement will be available to the student
      for inspection and discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to considering a grade appeal, students are expected to discuss
      course-related questions or concerns with their instructor directly so
      that the instructor has the opportunity to work with the student to seek
      resolution. Students are also expected to contact their student success
      counselor as soon as questions or concerns arise so that administration
      has an opportunity to help facilitate immediate resolution prior to the
      end of the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      If direct communication with faculty and staff does not bring satisfactory
      resolution and the student feels that institutional standards and policies
      have not been upheld, an appeal of the instructor's grading decision may
      be made.
      <strong
        >The burden of proof rests with the student to demonstrate the grade
        assigned for the course was made on the basis of any of the following
        conditions:</strong
      >
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A grading decision was made on some basis other than performance and
        other than as a penalty for academic dishonesty.
      </li>
      <li>
        A grading decision was based on unreasonably different standards from
        those applied to other students.
      </li>
      <li>
        A grading decision was based on a substantial, unreasonable, or
        unannounced departure from the course objectives and assignments.
      </li>
    </ul>
        

    <p>
      Appeals which do not demonstrate that grading was made on the basis of one
      of these conditions will be dismissed. The student must submit the grade
      appeal request, including all supporting documentation, within three (3)
      weeks after the final grade is recorded. Appeal requests are submitted in
      the Student Portal. Grades shall be considered final if no appeal is filed
      within this time.
    </p>

     
        
    <h4>Grade Appeal Process</h4>
    <p>
      Upon receiving a grade appeal request and supporting documentation, the
      Office of Student Affairs will forward the appeal to the Program Director
      (or designee) who oversees the faculty member. The Program Director will
      make a determination and the student will be notified of the determination
      within two (2) weeks of appealâ€™s initiation. Grade appeal determinations
      will include one of the following recommended actions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Lowering the original grade(s) in accordance with the grading review.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirming and upholding the original grade(s) from the instructor.
      </li>
      <li>Raising original grade(s) in accordance with the grading review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Provost Appeal Process</h4>
    <p>
      If the decision is made to deny the appeal and uphold the original grade,
      the student may appeal the decision to the Provost or designee, who will
      appoint a review panel consisting of other faculty and Program Director(s)
      not involved in the original appeal. The appeal, with supporting
      documentation, must be filed within two (2) weeks of the receipt of the
      original decision. The review panel may request additional information as
      determined necessary. The panel will review the submitted documentation
      and recommend one of the following actions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Lowering the original grade(s) in accordance with the grading review.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirming and upholding the original grade(s) from the instructor.
      </li>
      <li>Raising original grade(s) in accordance with the grading review.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      No later than three (3) weeks from the filing of the appeal with the
      Provost or his/her designee, the student will be notified of the final
      decision.
