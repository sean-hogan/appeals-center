Satisfactory Academic Progress measures a student’s performance in the following three areas: cumulative completion rate, cumulative grade point average (GPA), and maximum time frame. The purpose of this policy is to inform students of the expectations required of them to make reasonable academic progress in order to earn a degree.

    <p>
       In general, the process ov SAP is as follows: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<p>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) applies to all students and denotes successful completion of coursework toward a degree in each trimester. Students who fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and/or course Completion Rate (CR) in a Maximum Time Frame (MTF) will face academic consequences, up to and including university withdrawal and loss of eligibility for all types of federal and state aid administered by CSU-Global.</p>

<p>In order to meet satisfactory academic progress requirements financial aid applicants and recipients must meet the qualitative and quantitative measurements outlined below:</p>

<p>Students are able to attempt up to 150% of the credits required to complete their degree. If a student will have to exceed the 150% attempted credits in order to graduate, then the student will be exceeding the Maximum Time Frame policy. The Maximum Time Frame policy is a part of what keeps a student in good academic standing, or Satisfactory Academic Progress. </p>

<p>The Registrar reviews student’s files at the end of each trimester. If it is determined that a student will need to exceed the Maximum Time Frame then a SAP hold will be placed on the students file. In addition, the student will have a SAP termination hold placed onto their account. Please note, the SAP termination hold is a Financial Aid hold. </p>

<p>All students who are placed who will exceed the Maximum Time Frame must submit an Maximum Time Frame Exception form in order to continue in their program. </p>

<p>Once it is determined a student will have to exceed 150% of the number of credit hours required for their degree they will be ineligible for financial aid. Students are not able to appeal to have financial aid reinstated.</p>

<h3>Appeal Review Guidelines</h3>
<p>When reviewing Maximum Time Frame appeals, the Student Appeal Committee will review the appeal looking at the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extenuating circumstances student faced during program</li>

<li>Past academic history</li>

<li>Strong study plan</li>

<li>Is the path back to good academic standing possible during the allowed timeframe</li>
</ul>

<h3>Appeal Outcomes</h3>

<p>The student's academic progress and any supporting documentation will be reviewed by the Student Appeals Committee who will come to one of two possible outcomes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Approved Academically; Student is provided a plan to complete their degree.</li>

<li>Denied Academically; Student is not able to continue with their program.</li>

<li>Rejected; Committee needs additional information and/or documentation before a decision can be reached.</li>
</ul>


<p>If the student is approved academically (and agrees to continue with classes), they will be provided a detailed plan on what they need to continue and complete their degree. The student will then work with their Student Success Counselor to register for courses. </p>

<p>If a student fails to follow the plan Student Affairs provides (withdraws and/or fails from courses) then the student will not be allowed to continue with courses.</p>

<h3>Provost Appeal</h3>
<p>Students who appeal their Maximum Time Frame and are denied have the option of filing a Provost Appeal SAP Form. The provost appeal must be submitted within 2 weeks of the decision of the Appeals Committee. The provost may request additional documentation from the student. No later than three (3) weeks from the filing of the appeal with the Provost or his/her designee, the student will be notified of the final decision.</p>

<p>Satisfactory Academic Progress measures a student’s performance in the following three areas: cumulative completion rate, cumulative grade point average (GPA), and maximum time frame. The purpose of this policy is to inform students of the expectations required of them to make reasonable academic progress in order to earn a degree. Students will be placed on SAP Probation if they fail to meet the minimum SAP standards after the SAP Warning trimester. SAP Probation status is noted on the transcript until the student returns to Good Academic Standing.</p>

<p>Students will receive notification of SAP Probation status from the Registrar's Office via email. In addition, the student will have a SAP Probation Hold and a SAP termination hold placed onto their account. Please note, the SAP termination hold is a Financial Aid hold and will be taken off the student's account if they are approved to continue receiving Financial Aid.</p>

<p>All students who are placed on Academic Probation must submit an  SAP Probation Appeal form in order to continue taking courses during the Probation period</p>

<h3>Appeal Review Guidelines</h3>
<p>When reviewing SAP Probation appeals, the Student Appeal Committee will review the appeal looking at the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extenuating circumstance during SAP Warning period</li>
<li>Past academic history</li>
<li>Strong study plan</li>
<li>Is the path back to good academic standing possible during the allowed timeframe</li>
</ul>

<h3>Appeal Outcomes</h3>
<p>The student's academic progress during the warning period and any supporting documentation will be reviewed by the Student Appeals Committee who will come to one of three possible outcomes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Approved Academically; Approved to continue receiving Financial Aid - Financial aid students in Academic Probation status ARE NOT eligible for Title IV funds unless a student appeal has been approved by the institution. The University will only approve a financial aid appeal if it determines that the student had an extenuating circumstance that occurred and prevented the student from successfully completing the coursework.</li>

<li>Approved Academically; Denied Financial Aid</li>

<li>Denied Academically; Denied for Financial Aid</li>

<li>Rejected; Committee needs additional information and/or documentation before a decision can be reached. </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, SAP Probation appeals will not be considered by the committee if:</p>

<ul>
<li>The student has a past due balance on their account</li>
<li>The student has a pending Incomplete grade for an term. </li>
<li>The student is missing official transcripts - this is especially important for anyone returning to CSU-Global after going to a different school</li>
</ul>

<p>If the student is approved academically (and agrees to continue with classes), they will be issued an Academic Plan (aka SAP Contract) that will detail what must be completed in order to get back into Good Academic Standing. This contract will be for either one or two whole trimesters. The contract is meant to help the student avoid SAP Suspension. The contract will be completed by the Office of Student Affairs and emailed to the student within 7 business days of the Committee’s decision.  The student must sign the contract and upload it back to their student portal. Once the contract is received and approved, the student will be registered by Student Affairs for their courses.</p>

<p>Students run the risk of going into SAP Suspension status if they break their contract in any way. Students who wish to adjust their contract must work directly with Student Affairs prior to the start of the term. The student will need to sign and submit a new contract after revisions are made.
</p>


<p>If a student meets the requirements outlined in the SAP contract then they will return to Good Academic Standing at the end of the trimester. If a student cannot meet the required standards outlined in the SAP contract then they will be placed on Academic Suspension.</p>

<p>Students on SAP Probation who have not registered and completed coursework within twelve months will be administratively withdrawn.</p>

<h3>Provost Appeal</h3>


<p>Students who appeal their SAP Probation and are denied have the option of filing a Provost Appeal SAP Form. The appeal, with supporting documentation, must be filed within two (2) weeks of the receipt of the original decision. The Provost or designee may request additional information as determined necessary. No later than three (3) weeks from the filing of the appeal with the Provost or his/her designee, the student will be notified of the final decision.</p>

The purpose of this policy is to inform students of the expectations required of them to make reasonable academic progress in order to earn a degree. Students who fail to clear SAP Probation status will be placed on Academic Suspension. Students placed on Academic Suspension retain limited access to their Student Portal for account information and student services.</p>

<p>Students will receive notification of SAP Suspension status from the Registrar's Office via email. In addition, the student will have a SAP Suspension hold placed onto their account. All students who are placed on Academic Suspension must submit an SAP Suspension Appeal form. Success Counselors are able to add the Suspension Appeal form to the student's portal upon request. </p>

<p>Supporting documentation is not necessarily required for a SAP Suspension Appeal, however, they could include it if it will help their appeal case. SAP Suspension Appeals will only be considered if all outstanding account balances have been paid and all official transcripts are on file. SAP Suspension appeals are reviewed by the Student Appeals committee.</p>

<h3>Appeal Review Guidelines</h3>

<li>Past academic history</li>
<li>Strong study plan</li>
<li>Is the path back to good academic standing possible during the allowed timeframe</li>
