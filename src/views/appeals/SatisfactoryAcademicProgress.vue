      <p class="lead">Each institution of higher education that receives Federal Title IV Funds is required by the U.S.Department of Education to define and enforce standards of satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress measures a student’s performance in the following three areas: cumulative completion rate, cumulative grade point average (GPA), and maximum time frame. The purpose of this policy is to inform students of the expectations required of them to make reasonable academic progress in order to earn a degree.

    <h4 id="sap-overview">SAP Overview</h4>
    <p>
       In general, the process ov SAP is as follows: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <p>
       Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) applies to all students and denotes successful completion of coursework toward a degree in each trimester. Students who fail to achieve minimum standards for grade point average and/or course Completion Rate (CR) in a Maximum Time Frame (MTF) will face academic consequences, up to and including university withdrawal and loss of eligibility for all types of federal and state aid administered by CSU-Global.
    </p>

    <p>In order to meet satisfactory academic progress requirements financial aid applicants and recipients must meet the qualitative and quantitative measurements outlined below:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Cumulative GPA Requirement:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Undergraduate Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for all credits attempted.</li>
                <li>Graduate Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 for all credits attempted.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Completion Rate:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Students must complete at least 66.66% of cumulative attempted credit hours. The completion rate is defined as the percentage of the total number of credits completed divided by the total number of credits attempted over the entirety of a student’s academic record at CSU- Global Campus. Transfer credits on the student’s record are included when computing the student’s completion rate. o (Credits Completed / Credits Attempted) x 100 = Completion Rate </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Maximum Time Frame:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Once students have attempted 150% of the number of credit hours required for their degree they will be ineligible for aid.</li>
                <li>Federal regulations allow financial aid recipients to receive financial aid for a maximum number of attempted credits. If at any point in time it is determined that a student cannot complete their program of study within 150% of the program length, the student will be ineligible for financial aid, unless the student successfully appeals.</li>
                <li>Transfer credit hours are included in the calculation of allowable maximum time frame.</li>
                <li>Attempted credit hours under all courses of study are included in the calculation of attempted and earned credit hours.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>All students will be evaluated for SAP at the end of each trimester. To remain in Good Academic Standing, students must maintain the following standards:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Undergraduate Students</strong> must maintain a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of at least 2.00 and a minimum course completion rate of 66.66% of all courses attempted. The MTF for undergraduate programs is 150% the normal duration of the program as measured in credit hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Graduate Students</strong> must maintain a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of at least 3.00 and a minimum course completion rate of 66.66% of all courses attempted. The MTF for graduate programs is 150% the normal duration of the program as measured in credit hours</li>

    <p>
       Students will be placed on SAP Probation if they fail to meet the minimum SAP standards after the SAP Warning trimester. SAP Probation status is noted on the transcript until the student returns to Good Academic Standing. 
    </p>

    <p>Students will receive notification of SAP Probation status from the Registrar's Office via email. In addition, the student will have a SAP Probation Hold and a SAP termination hold placed onto their account. Please note, the SAP termination hold is a Financial Aid hold and will be taken off the student's account if they are approved to continue receiving Financial Aid.</p>

    <p>After the student's account is placed on SAP Probation, the student advisor will also receive a SAP Probation notification activity in CVue. Student Advisors are required to contact the student immediately via phone to discuss the SAP Probation process [refer to the probation email for the due date of the appeal form and documentation, a conversation about what qualifies as supporting documentation (for Financial Aid appeal), our timeline for review, and other payment options available].</p>

    <p>Important to note from the FSA Handbook:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial Aid eligibility for SAP Probation student can be reinstated for one payment period (one trimester for a degree-seeking program, 1 loan period for certificates) (FSA Handbook Volume 1, Chapter 1, p.1-13).</li>
        <li>Financial Aid eligibility for SAP Probation student cannot be less than one payment period (one Trimesters) (FSA Handbook Volume 1, Chapter 1, p.1-15).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All students who are placed on Academic Probation must submit an Academic SAP Appeal form and supporting documentation in order to continue taking courses during the Probation period. If a student moves into SAP Probation while they are currently enrolled in a course (i.e. after a trimester with only a week break) then the student will be required to submit their probation for and supporting documentation by <strong>10:00 am on the Friday of week 1</strong>. All documents should be uploaded back into the student portal for review. If a student is having difficulty uploading forms then they are able to send it directly to their Student Success Counselor. The SSC will then forward that paperwork to <a href="mailto:student.affairs@csuglobal.edu">student.affairs@csuglobal.edu</a>. The SAP Probation Appeal form and supporting documentation will be reviewed by the Appeals Committee.</p>

    <h5>SAP Probation Timeline</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Student moves from SAP Warning to SAP Probation</li>
        <li>Student's Account: Student Recieves email notification from Registrar</li>
        <li>Advisor recieves SAP probation Activity in Cvue</li>
        <li>Etc</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Probation Outcomes</h5>
    <p>The student's academic progress during the warning period and any supporting documentation will be reviewed by the committee who will come to one of three possible outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Approved Academically; Approved to continue receiving Financial Aid - <strong>Financial aid students in Academic Probation status ARE NOT eligible for Title IV funds unless a student appeal has been approved by the institution. The University will only approve a financial aid appeal if it determines that the student had an extenuating circumstance that occurred and prevented the student from successfully completing the coursework.</strong> </li>
        <li>Approved Academically; Denied Financial Aid</li>
        <li>Denied Academically; Denied for Financial Aid </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Please note, SAP Probation appeals will not be considered by the committee if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supporting documentation was not included</li>
        <li>The student has a past due balance on their account</li>
        <li>The student is missing official transcripts - this is especially important for anyone returning to CSU-Global after going to a different school</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the student is approved academically (and agrees to continue with classes), they will be issued an Academic Plan (aka SAP Contract) that will detail what must be completed in order to get back into Good Academic Standing. This contract will be for either one or two whole trimesters. The contract is meant to help the student avoid SAP Suspension. The contract will be completed by the Office of Student Affairs and emailed to the student immediately following the committee's decision. The student must sign the contract and upload it back to their student portal. Once the contract is received and approved, the student will be registered by Student Affairs for their courses. </p>

    <p>Students run the risk of going into SAP Suspension status if they break their contract in any way. Students who wish to adjust their contract must work directly with Student Affairs prior to the start of the term. The student will need to sign and submit a new contract after revisions are made. </p>

    <p>If a student meets the requirements outlined in the SAP contract then they will return to Good Academic Standing. If a student cannot meet the required standards outlined in the SAP contract then they will be placed on Academic Suspension.</p>

    <p>Students on SAP Probation who have not registered and completed coursework within twelve months will be administratively withdrawn.</p>

SAP Suspension appeals are reviewed by the Appeals committee. </p>

    <h5>SAP Suspension Appeal Form Info</h5>
    
    <p>The SAP Suspension Appeal Form includes the following questions for students to answer:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What extenuating circumstances occurred during your previous enrollment to prevent you from successfully completing your coursework?</li>
        <li>What are your goals in pursuing a degree?</li>
        <li>How will you adjust your schedule and commitments to ensure that you have at least 10 hours per week to devote to class participation?</li>

        <li>How can CSU-Global best support you in accomplishing your goals and helping to keep you on track</li>

    </ul>

    <h5>Successful Appeals</h5>
    <p>Students on Academic Suspension who successfully appeal their suspension can return to the university in SAP Probation II status and will be required to sign a contract for one (1) or two (2) trimesters.  </p>

    
        <p>Any breach of the contract after the term has started will result in SAP Suspension. Students who wish to adjust their contract prior to the first term of the contract will work directly with Student Affairs (student.affairs@csuglobal.edu). </p>

    <p>Students on SAP Probation II will re-enter the university under the current catalog and university requirements. Students may be granted an administrative waiver to return under their previous program based on the committee decision. Students on SAP Probation II will remain under the guidelines of the catalog in effect at the time of their initial admission.  It is not recommended that students in SAP Probation II change programs. Students on Academic Suspension who successfully appeal their suspension must enroll and complete classes in the next available term or the appeal will be negated and the student will be suspended.</p>

    <p>Students in SAP Probation II are never eligible for Financial Aid and must use alternative payment options until they return to good academic standing.</p>

    <p>Students who appeal their SAP Suspension and are denied have the option of filing a Provost Appeal SAP Form. The provost appeal must be submitted within 2 weeks of the decision of the Appeals Committee.  The provost may request additional documentation from the student. The provost will notify the student of the final appeal decision within 3 weeks of receiving the Provost Appeal SAP Form. The appeal decision of the provost is final.</p>

    <!--------------------------------------------->
    
    <h4 id="financial-aid">Financial Aid & SAP</h4>
        <p>Federal regulations and CSU-Global policy require that students who are receiving federal financial aid (FA) must make academic progress as defined by the Academic Expectations Policies <a href="https://csuglobal.edu/student-policies/academic-expectations-policies/">https://csuglobal.edu/student-policies/academic-expectations-policies/</a> </p>
        <p>Failure to make good academic progress while in SAP Warning may result in a students eligibility for FA to be suspended. When a student becomes ineligible for FA due to the SAP policy, they may be able to regain eligibility by a successful appeal based on an extenuating circumstance that occurred during the timeframe stated in their SAP Warning.</p> 
        <p>**It is important to note students will most likely need to seek alternative financing options during the SAP Probation period, such as paying out of pocket or with a non-federal loan. Upon return to good academic standing, students may resume FA eligibility.</p>

        <h5>SAP Warning - Financial Aid Eligible</h5>
        <p>The first trimester that a student is unable to meet good academic standing requirements will result in a SAP Warning notice. In this SAP status, students will remain eligible for FA and have one trimester to return to good standing.</p>

        <h5>SAP Probation - Financial Aid Ineligible</h5>
        <p>When a student moves to SAP Probation, they become ineligible for financial aid. There is a possibility to appeal when an extenuating circumstance occurred during the warning period.</p>
        <h5>SAP Suspension - Financial Aid Ineligible</h5>

        <p>Students are not eligible for financial aid.</p>
