    <ul>
        <li>Deny the appeal  </li>
        <li>Approve the appeal on the basis that there is evidence that the decision was not made in accordance with  university policy. The Provost may remand the matter back to the appropriate appeals committee for further  review.</li> 
        <li>Approve the appeal on the basis that the decision was not based on all the available facts relevant to the matter  or that new and significant information has become available since the appeals committee review. The Provost  may remand the matter back to the appropriate appeals committee for further review. </li>
        <li>Reduce the sanction on the basis that the sanction or remedy imposed is not in proportion to the nature and  seriousness of the matter. </li>
        <li>Approve the appeal on the basis that there is evidence that the decision was prejudicial, arbitrary or capricious.</li>
